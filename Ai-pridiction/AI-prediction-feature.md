# AI Prediction for Auto-Scaling and Auto-Descaling of VMware (Future Scope)

## Overview
This feature aims to integrate **AI-based predictions** for **auto-scaling** and **auto-descaling** of VMware virtual machines based on historical CPU and RAM usage data from log files. By utilizing machine learning, the system will predict the resource requirements and dynamically adjust the allocated CPU and RAM for VMware VMs.

This feature will be developed in the `ai-prediction` branch and focuses on automating VMware resource management based on predictive AI models.

## Features

- **AI-based Prediction Model**: Trained using historical system performance data (CPU and RAM usage).
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically increases resource allocation based on predictions of higher future usage.
- **Auto-Descaling**: Reduces allocated resources when predicted usage is low.
- **VMware API Integration**: Integrates with VMwareâ€™s API to dynamically adjust resources.
