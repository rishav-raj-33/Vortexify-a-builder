## ðŸ“Œ What is Git Branching Strategy?

A **Git branching strategy** is a plan or set of conventions used to manage branches in a version control system. It helps teams organize work, collaborate efficiently, reduce conflicts, and maintain a stable codebase.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why is Branching Strategy Useful?

- Allows **parallel development** of multiple features or modules.
- Ensures **code isolation**, reducing unwanted interference.
- Keeps the `main` branch **stable and production-ready**.
- Makes testing, debugging, and deployment **easier and modular**.
- Improves **team collaboration** and workflow structure.

## ðŸš€ Branching Strategy for This Repository

The Vortexify project follows a **module-based branching strategy** where each major system component has its own dedicated branch. This allows focused development and testing of each module without affecting the main branch or other modules.

## ðŸŒ± Branching Overview

| Branch Name       | Module Focus       |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `main`            | Documentation, SRS, final production-ready merged code |
| `skin-module`     | Frontend (Laravel / Optional React) |
| `brain-module`    | Backend (Spring Boot) |
| `heart-module`    | Automation Scripts (Python / Shell) |

## ðŸ”¬ Testability & Development Benefits

- Each module can be **independently developed and tested**.
- Helps in **unit-level debugging** and module-specific CI pipelines.
- Reduces the risk of **merge conflicts** and code breaks.
- Enhances **clarity** during code reviews and issue tracking.
- Encourages **clean merges** and organized pull requests.

---

## âœ… Final Merge Plan

- Once development of any module is complete and tested, its branch will be **merged into the `main` branch**, which acts as the final integration point.
- After integrating all modules, a **final round of testing** will be performed to validate the complete product.
